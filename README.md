*numberize* is an R package to convert numbers written as English,
French or Spanish words from `"zero"` to `"nine hundred and ninety nine
trillion, nine hundred and ninety nine billion, nine hundred and ninety
nine million, nine hundred and ninety nine thousand, nine hundred and
ninety nine"` to positive integer values, and vice versa.

*numberize* is developed at the [Centre for the Mathematical Modelling
of Infectious
Diseases](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases)
at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as part of the
[Epiverse-TRACE program](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).

## Installation

The package can be installed from CRAN using

``` r
install.packages("numberize")
```

### Development version

You can install the development version of *numberize* from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r

```

## Example

These examples illustrate the current functionalities.

``` r
library("numberize")

# numberize a French string
numberize("zéro", lang = "fr")
#> [1] 0

# numberize a Spanish string
numberize("Siete mil quinientos cuarenta y cinco", lang = "es")
#> [1] 7545

# verbalize a number in French
verbalize(21, lang = "fr")
#> [1] "vingt et un"

# numberize the English string "nine hundred and ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred and ninety-nine billion, nine hundred and ninety-nine million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine" # nolint: line_length_linter.
formatC(numberize("nine hundred and ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred and ninety-nine billion, nine hundred and ninety-nine million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine"), big.mark = ",", format = "fg") # nolint: line_length_linter.
#> [1] "999,999,999,999,999"

# some edge cases
numberize("veintiún", lang = "es")
#> [1] 21
numberize("veintiuno", lang = "es")
#> [1] 21

# convert a vector of written values
numberize(
  text = c(17, "dix", "soixante-cinq", "deux mille vingt-quatre", NA),
  lang = "fr"
)
#> [1]   17   10   65 2024   NA
```
