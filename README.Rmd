_{{ packagename }}_ is an R package to convert numbers written as English, French or Spanish words from `"zero"` to `"nine hundred and ninety nine trillion, nine hundred and ninety nine billion, nine hundred and ninety nine million, nine hundred and ninety nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine"` to positive integer values.

<!-- This sentence is optional and can be removed -->
_{{ packagename }}_ is developed at the [{{ department }}]({{ department_url }}) at the {{ institution }} as part of the [Epiverse-TRACE program](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).


## Installation

The package can be installed from CRAN using

```r
install.packages("{{packagename}}")
```

### Development version

You can install the development version of _{{ packagename }}_ from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
pak::pak("{{ gh_repo }}")
```

## Example

These examples illustrate the current functionality.

```{r eval=TRUE}
library("numberize")

# numberize a French string
numberize("zéro", lang = "fr")

# numberize a Spanish string
numberize("Siete mil quinientos cuarenta y cinco", lang = "es")

# verbalize a number in French
verbalize("21", lang = "fr")

# numberize the English string "nine hundred and ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred and ninety-nine billion, nine hundred and ninety-nine million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine" # nolint: line_length_linter.
formatC(numberize("nine hundred and ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred and ninety-nine billion, nine hundred and ninety-nine million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine"), big.mark = ",", format = "fg") # nolint: line_length_linter.

# some edge cases
numberize("veintiún", lang = "es")
numberize("veintiuno", lang = "es")

# convert a vector of written values
numberize(
  text = c(17, "dix", "soixante-cinq", "deux mille vingt-quatre", NA),
  lang = "fr"
)
```
