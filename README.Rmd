_{{ packagename }}_ is an R package to convert numbers written as English, French or Spanish words from `"zero"` to `"nine hundred and ninety nine trillion, nine hundred and ninety nine billion, nine hundred and ninety nine million, nine hundred and ninety nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine"` from a character string to a numeric value.

<!-- This sentence is optional and can be removed -->
_{{ packagename }}_ is developed at the [{{ department }}]({{ department_url }}) at the {{ institution }} as part of the [Epiverse-TRACE program](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).


## Installation

You can install the development version of _{{ packagename }}_ from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r echo=TRUE, results="hide", message=FALSE}
if (system.file(package = "numberizer") == "") pak::pak("{{ gh_repo }}")
library("numberize")
```

## Example

These examples illustrate the current functionality.

```{r eval=TRUE}
# numberize a French string
numberize("zéro",  lang = "fr")

# numberize a Spanish string
numberize("Siete mil quinientos cuarenta y cinco", lang = "es")

# numberize the English string "nine hundred and ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred and ninety-nine billion, nine hundred and ninety-nine million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine" # nolint: line_length_linter.
formatC(numberize("nine hundred and ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred and ninety-nine billion, nine hundred and ninety-nine million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine"), big.mark = ",", format = "fg") # nolint: line_length_linter.

# some edge cases
numberize("veintiún", lang = "es")
numberize("veintiuno", lang = "es")
```
